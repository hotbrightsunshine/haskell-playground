* Basics
I'm glad you took some time to look at my learning progress. Here, you'll find functions that are part of the 'beginner' part of my Haskell learning journey. 
Folds, scans, datatypes and lists are the main topics here. You'll be likely to find my implementation of the exercises found in the Haskell Wikibook and some 
in the Real World Haskell Book (especially the first ones).
I hope you'll find them useful! ~
