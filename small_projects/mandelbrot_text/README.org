* mandelbrot-text
    This short, inefficient, and rookish project lets you display the mandelbrot set given: 
    + A *Threshold*, or the total number of iterations (the more they are, the slower it becomes),
    + A *Scale* which indicates how you zoom into the set. It's centered and there is no way to see further,
    + A *Precision* which specifies how precise the final rendering should be.
