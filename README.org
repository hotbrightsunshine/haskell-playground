* Welcome to hotbrightsunshine's Haskell Playground!
  This repository containes all of the functions I write while learning Haskell.
  + ~basics~ has some source files regarding elementary concepts of Haskell,
  + ~resources~ containes some useful resources to learn Haskell, divided in exercises, theory and more,
